## About Me
Jarrett Dougherty is a full-stack web developer who also specializes in social media and project management. The experience of helping people turn their dream projects into realities is the driving force behind his work. He holds a degree from Rutgers University (BS), awarded with highest honors, and recently received a certificate in Full-Stack Web Development from the University of Pennsylvania.

Jarrett has skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, MongoDB, React.js, and responsive web design. He is also adept at team management, project coordination, and creative collaboration. Utilizing these skills, Jarrett has successfully taken a music industry brand from relative obscurity to international renown. Websites, webstores, and social media accounts that he created and managed have serviced hundreds of thousands of customers on a global scale. He also has extensive experience in merchandise production and distribution. His passion for problem solving, whether applied to designing a beautifully simple web application or overseeing a full team project launch, reflects Jarrettâ€™s unique talent for understanding the broad strokes of a vision while never missing a detail.

Though forever a New Jersey boy at heart, Jarrett has called Philadelphia, PA home for the past decade. There he owns a home with his partner Kristina... but the true boss of that house is an orange cat named Nacho.
